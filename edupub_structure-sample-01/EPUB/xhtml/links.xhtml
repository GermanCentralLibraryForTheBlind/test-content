						<h3>4.3 Bibliographic reference</h3>
					</header>
					<p>The United States becomes more ethnically and linguistically diverse every year. More than
						90 percent of new residents come from non-English-speaking countries. The number of students
						with non-English-speaking backgrounds represents the fastest growing group of this
						population. In the last decade, the total student enrollment in public schools increased by
						only 14 percent, while the number of English learners grew 70 percent and is projected to
						grow even more <a epub:type="biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#P70004858060007AC"
							>(Abernathy, 2007)</a>. The 2000 U.S. Census identified 20 percent of school-age children
						as non-native English speakers).</p>
					<p>The National League for Nursing (NLN) recognized that if nurses are to become effective
						users of the electronic health records, nurses need to be educated. The NLN called for
						reform to nursing education to promote quality education that prepares technologysavvy
						nurses who can use electronic health records. The NLN Board of Governors (<a
							epub:type="biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#P70004858060007AD">2008</a>) issued a
						position statement calling for both prelicensure and graduate nursing education programs to
						provide EHR education and hands on experiences for students.</p>
					<p>Well-done and appropriate assessments are the basis for all successful special education and
						transition programming. In order to ensure appropriate testing practices, the IDEA addressed
						assessment concerns in the 1990, 1997, and 2004 amendments. The IDEA of 1990 required
						Individualized Education Program (IEP) assessments to be unbiased and given in the native
						language of the student. In addition, placement in special education was to be based upon a
						multifactored evaluation that included multiple assessments across more than one environment
							(<a epub:type="biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#P70004858060007AE">C. K. Bennett,
							Journal of Staff Development, Winter 1984</a>).</p>

					<p>Professor Fairâ€™s U.S. and multicountry models are available for use on the Internet free of
						charge. The address is <a class="ulink" href="http://fairmodel.econ.yale.edu"
							>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>fairmodel.econ.yale.edu</a>. Many teachers have found that
						having students work with the U.S. model on the Internet is a useful complement to an
						introductory macroeconomics course.</p>
