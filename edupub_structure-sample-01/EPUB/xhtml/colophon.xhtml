			<p>He who breaks this ebook or puts it in water or rubs it until you cannot recognize it [and]
				cannot make it to be understood, may Ashur, Sin, Shamash, Adad and Ishtar, Bel, Nergal, Ishtar of
				Ninevah, Ishtar of Arbela, Ishtar of Bit Kidmurri, the gods of heaven and earth and the gods of
				Assyria, may all these curse him with a curse that cannot be relieved, terrible and merciless, as
				long as he lives, may they let his name, his seed, be carried off from the land, may they put his
				flesh in a dogâ€™s mouth</p>
