				<h1>Preface Section</h1>
			</header>
			<p>This is Preface text. The United States becomes more ethnically and linguistically diverse every
				year. More than 90 percent of new residents come from non-English-speaking countries. The number
				of students with non-English-speaking backgrounds represents the fastest growing group of this
				population. In the last decade, the total student enrollment in public schools increased by only
				14 percent, while the number of English learners grew 70 percent and is projected to grow even
				more (<a epub:type="biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#P70004858060006B2">National
					Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education, 1999</a>). The 2000 U.S. Census identified 20 percent of
				school-age children as non-native English speakers (<a epub:type="biblioref"
					href="bibliography.xhtml#P70004858060006B1">Jamieson, Curry, &amp; Martinez, 2001</a>).</p>
			<p>Teachers everywhere face enormous challenges in their classrooms. They are expected to meet the
				needs of an increasingly diverse population. There is more content to teach each year as well.
				Teachers are now expected to integrate technology and teach to myriad standards, and they are
				judged by the standardized test scores achieved by their students, with no excuses tolerated and
				little understanding of the challenges they face daily in the classroom.</p>
			<p>This fourth edition of <span class="emphasis">50 Strategies for Teaching English Language Learners
				</span>includes a number of features to support teachers in meeting some of the more daunting
				challenges of the 21st-century classroom.</p>

				<p>Reading and understanding the theoretical overview (<a 
						href="part01.xhtml#P70004858060006B5">Section I</a>) is vital to understanding the basic principles of
					instructing and assessing English learners. This should be approached first. The other sections
					can be approached one strategy at a time, but one or two strategies from each section should be
					tried first before working through each section. Strategies that are the easiest to implement
					are listed first in each category. It makes sense for students or beginning teachers to build
					their repertoire of strategies gradually, sampling from all five sections. After that, the text
					can easily be used as a resource book.</p>
				<p>When you notice a need among your students, look for a strategy to meet that need. Keep in mind
					the basic principles of teaching English learners. You must support their understanding with
					realia, visuals, and contextualized language. It is vital to emphasize vocabulary, fluency, and
					building background knowledge for comprehension. Students must be actively engaged to benefit
					fully from instruction. They must be given opportunities to demonstrate their growing skills in
					authentic <span title="xv" epub:type="pagebreak" id="P70004858060006AC"
					></span>tasks and in a nonstressful environment. This text is written with the goal of
					providing this type of classroom for all students.</p>
