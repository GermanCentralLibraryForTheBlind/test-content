<p>This is the house in which JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH was born.</p>

<span class="caption">THE HOUSE IN WHICH BACH WAS BORN.</span></div>
<p>This house stands in the town of Eisenach in Germany. It looks very much the same today as it did when Sebastian was a little boy. Many people go there to visit this house because the little boy grew to be a famous man.</p>
<p><a class="pageno" title="[Pg 4]" id="pgepubid00001"/> In Eisenach there is a statue of Bach near the palace.</p>

<span class="caption">STATUE OF BACH AT EISENACH.</span></div>
<p>In the same town in which Sebastian was born there stands on the top of a hill a very famous castle built many hundreds of years ago.</p>
<p>This castle is called the Wartburg.</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="www.gutenberg.org@files@34568@34568-h@images@illus04.jpg" alt="THE CASTLE AT WARTBURG." title="THE CASTLE AT WARTBURG." width="584" height="282"/><br/>
<span class="caption">THE CASTLE AT WARTBURG.</span></div>
<p>As a boy little Sebastian used to climb the hill with his friends, and they, no doubt, had a happy time playing about the castle grounds. In one of its great halls the minstrels of Germany held their Song Contests.</p>
<p><a class="pageno" title="[Pg 5]" id="pgepubid00002"/> When Sebastian was old enough he used to travel afoot, just as the minstrels did; his purpose was to go to hear fine organ players. Once as he sat weary by the roadside someone threw a herring to him so that he might eat as he rested.</p>

<span class="caption">BACH EATING THE HERRING.</span></div>
<p>Little Sebastian's father was named JOHANN AMBROSIUS BACH. He, too, was a musician, as his people had been for many years.</p>

<span class="caption">JOHANN AMBROSIUS BACH.</span></div>
<p><a class="pageno" title="[Pg 6]" id="pgepubid00003"/> One of these was a miller who played and sang while the corn was grinding. His name was Veit Bach, and his little boy was called Hans, the Player, because he, too, loved to play the violin.</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="www.gutenberg.org@files@34568@34568-h@images@illus07.jpg" alt="VEIT BACH AND HIS SON HANS." title="VEIT BACH AND HIS SON HANS." width="584" height="358"/><br/>
<span class="caption">VEIT BACH AND HIS SON HANS.</span></div>
<p>When Sebastian was ten years old his father and mother died. So he went to live with his brother, whose home was a few miles away.</p>
<p>Of this brother Sebastian had music lessons, and he improved so rapidly that he used to beg to be allowed to play the pieces in a big book in the library.</p>
<p>But the brother refused him this pleasure. However, little Sebastian was eager to learn all the music he could find, so he used to sit up on moonlight nights and copy these pages while his brother was asleep.</p>
<p>But what do you think happened when he had copied everything in that big book?</p>
<p>His brother found out what he had done and took all his precious music away from him.</p>

<span class="caption">BACH COPYING MUSIC BY MOONLIGHT.</span></div>
<p>If you know any boy who is about twenty years old you may say to him, Bach was as old as you are when Benjamin Franklin was born in Boston.</p>
<p>And although there was this difference of twenty years or so in their ages, we may think of them at work in the world at the same time. You must remember that all men like Franklin and Bach who became famous did so by working very hard.</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="www.gutenberg.org@files@34568@34568-h@images@illus09.jpg" alt="BENJAMIN FRANKLIN." title="BENJAMIN FRANKLIN." width="400" height="481"/><br/>
<span class="caption">BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.</span></div>
<p><a class="pageno" title="[Pg 8]" id="pgepubid00005"/> Franklin, too, was born very poor. Once he walked the streets of Philadelphia with a loaf of bread under each arm. But by being faithful in all he did he became the friend of all his countrymen and of Kings and Queens besides.</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin was quite a little younger than Sebastian Bach. But there was a famous man who was almost exactly Sebastian's age. This man composed an Oratorio that is loved by everybody. It is sung in cities and towns all over the world, particularly at Christmas time.</p>
<p>Do you happen to know the name of this Oratorio? If not, you can surely learn it by asking someone or by looking it up in a book.</p>
<p>Write in the name of the composer of this Oratorio below the picture, and write on this line the name of the Oratorio itself.</p>
<hr class="hrbd"/>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="www.gutenberg.org@files@34568@34568-h@images@illus10.jpg" alt="" title="" width="400" height="507"/></div>
<p>The composer's name is</p>
<hr class="hrbd"/>
<p><a class="pageno" title="[Pg 9]" id="pgepubid00006"/> The Oratorio, the name of which you have just written, was first sung in the Irish city of Dublin, 1742.</p>
<p>At that time Sebastian Bach was living in Leipsic and had been for many years at the head of the Thomas School. He was known as its Cantor. Bach worked very hard here to supply music for several of the Leipsic churches, and he worked so well that his fame spread until it reached the ears of the Emperor.</p>
<p>Frederick the Great was also a musician and composer. So he invited Sebastian Bach to visit him at his castle. There were many people present, but Sebastian Bach was the principal guest. He played on many of the Emperor's fine pianos. When he reached home again he composed a musical work and dedicated it to the Emperor.</p>

<span class="caption">BACH PLAYING BEFORE FREDERICK THE GREAT.</span></div>
<p><a class="pageno" title="[Pg 10]" id="pgepubid00007"/> The kind of a piano that Sebastian Bach played on was not called a piano in his day. It was called a Clavier or Clavichord.</p>
<p>Some day you will study a collection of pieces by Sebastian Bach which was written for this instrument and was called <i>The Well Tempered Clavichord</i>.</p>
<p>This is the kind of piano, or clavichord, that Bach used.</p>

<p>Sebastian Bach had a very large family, twenty children altogether. Two of them studied music faithfully with their father.</p>
<p>One was Friedmann, for whom the father wrote a book called <i>Little Preludes</i>. Friedmann's brother, Philipp Emanuel Bach, was a very fine clavichord player. He wrote a book about music and composed many pieces.</p>

<p><a class="pageno" title="[Pg 12]" id="pgepubid00009"/> Sebastian Bach died in 1750. He was sixty-five years of age.</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin was at that time forty-four years old and George Washington was eighteen.</p>
<p>This is the way Bach wrote his name.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or<br/>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual<br/>
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a<br/>
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by<br/>
your equipment.<br/>
<br/>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm<br/>
<br/>
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of<br/>
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers<br/>
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists<br/>
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from<br/>
people in all walks of life.<br/>
<br/>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the<br/>
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's<br/>
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will<br/>
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project<br/>
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure<br/>
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.<br/>

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg<br/>
Literary Archive Foundation<br/>
<br/>
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide<br/>
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of<br/>
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be<br/>
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest<br/>
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations<br/>
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt<br/>
status with the IRS.<br/>
<br/>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating<br/>
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United<br/>
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a<br/>
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up<br/>
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations<br/>
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To<br/>
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any<br/>
particular state visit http://pglaf.org<br/>
<br/>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we<br/>
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition<br/>
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who<br/>
approach us with offers to donate.<br/>
<br/>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make<br/>
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from<br/>
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.<br/>
<br/>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation<br/>
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other<br/>
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card<br/>
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate<br/>

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic<br/>
works.<br/>
<br/>
Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm<br/>
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared<br/>
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project<br/>
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed<br/>
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.<br/>
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily<br/>
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:<br/>
<br/>
     http://www.gutenberg.net<br/>
<br/>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,<br/>
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary<br/>
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to<br/>
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.<br/>
