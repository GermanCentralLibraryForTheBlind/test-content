        <h2>Making These Images Accessible</h2>
        <p> Many images don't need to be made accessible if their function in the text is purely decorative or if they convey information
          that is also provided in the text. </p>
        <p> The first image, a graphic of an open book, is an icon used to highlight a recurring section at the end of each chapter. It is a
          decorative image and does not need to be made accessible. However, it should be tagged so that a screen reader will know to skip
          it. </p>
        <p> The code used for this in an EPUB 3 file is: </p>
        <pre>
&lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="" role="presentation" /&gt;
</pre>
        <p>In a DAISY file, the code used is: </p>
        <pre>
&lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="" /&gt;
</pre>
        <p> The second image is an author photo that accompanies a short biography of the author. There are two options for making this
          image accessible. The appropriate option depends on the accessibility of the text associated with the image. </p>
        <dl>
          <dt> Option 1: </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>If the dates below the photo are live text and will be read by a screen reader, the accompanying photo can be identified with
              a short alt text of: "Photo of Kay Boyle." All other information is included in the caption and the box text. </p>
            <p> In both DAISY and EPUB 3, the following code can be used: </p>
            <pre>
&lt;img src="kayboyle.jpg" alt="Photo of Kay Boyle" />
</pre>
          </dd>
          <dt> Option 2: </dt>
          <dd>
            <p> If the dates below the photo are embedded in the image and will therefore not be read by a screen reader, the photo should
              be identified with a short alt text of: "Photo of Kay Boyle, who lived from 1902 to 1992." </p>
            <p> In both DAISY and EPUB 3, the following code can be used: </p>
            <pre>&lt;img src="kayboyle.jpg" alt="Photo of Kay Boyle, who lived from 1902 to 1992" />
</pre>
          </dd>
